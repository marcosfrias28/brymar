- **Toast Notifications**: Mocked for user feedback testing

### Test Utilities

- **Custom Render**: Wrapper with providers for consistent testing
- **Mock Data Factories**: Reusable mock data generation
- **Accessibility Helpers**: Utilities for accessibility testing
- **Responsive Helpers**: Viewport simulation utilities
- **Error Simulation**: Utilities for triggering various error states
