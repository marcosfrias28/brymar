# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migrations for the simplified architecture.

## Usage

Migrations are managed using Drizzle Kit. To generate and run migrations:

```bash
# Generate migration from schema changes
npx drizzle-kit generate

# Push changes to database (development)
npx drizzle-kit push

# Run migrations (production)
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

## Migration Files

Migration files are automatically generated by Drizzle Kit based on schema changes in `src/lib/db/schema/`.

## Schema Structure

The database schema is organized into feature-based files:

- `users.ts` - User authentication and profile data
- `properties.ts` - Property listings and related data
- `lands.ts` - Land listings and related data
- `blog.ts` - Blog posts and content management
- `wizard.ts` - Wizard drafts and AI generation tracking

Each schema file includes:

- Main entity tables
- Related tables (favorites, views, inquiries)
- Type inference exports for TypeScript
