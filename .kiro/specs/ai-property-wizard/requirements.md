# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a modern, AI-powered property listing wizard that transforms the property creation experience into an intuitive, step-by-step process. The wizard integrates free AI assistance through HuggingFace Inference API to automatically generate compelling property descriptions, optimized titles, and market-relevant content. The system includes advanced image handling capabilities that bypass Vercel's 1MB limit through direct cloud storage uploads, interactive Dominican Republic location mapping, and a comprehensive preview system before publication.
