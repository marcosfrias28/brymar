# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a unified, consistent, and flexible layout system for all dashboard routes in the Brymar Inmobiliaria platform. The current dashboard pages have inconsistent layouts, poor spacing, and design inconsistencies that negatively impact the user experience. This improvement will establish a standardized layout component that maintains the existing aesthetic while incorporating better UX/UI practices and enhanced use of the secondary color palette.
