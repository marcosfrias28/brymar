# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical DDD (Domain-Driven Design) architecture issues preventing the application from building successfully. The current implementation has missing shared schemas, incomplete exports, and broken imports that need to be resolved to achieve a fully functional DDD-compliant application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Shared Domain Schemas

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete shared domain schemas so that DTOs can properly validate input data across all bounded contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing shared schemas THEN all required schema exports SHALL be available
2. WHEN validating input data THEN schemas SHALL provide proper type safety and validation
3. WHEN using schemas across different bounded contexts THEN they SHALL be consistently available

### Requirement 2: Complete Action Exports

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all referenced server actions to be properly exported so that components can import and use them without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing server actions THEN all referenced functions SHALL be exported
2. WHEN components use server actions THEN imports SHALL resolve successfully
3. WHEN building the application THEN no missing export errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 3: Missing Hook Functions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all referenced hook functions to exist and be properly exported so that components can use them without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components import hooks THEN all referenced functions SHALL exist
2. WHEN using hooks in components THEN they SHALL provide proper functionality
3. WHEN building the application THEN no missing hook errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 4: DDD Layer Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow DDD principles correctly so that business logic is properly separated and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing domain logic THEN it SHALL be contained in the domain layer
2. WHEN creating DTOs THEN they SHALL properly validate using domain schemas
3. WHEN using repositories THEN they SHALL follow the repository pattern correctly
4. WHEN implementing use cases THEN they SHALL coordinate between layers properly

### Requirement 5: Build Success

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without any TypeScript or import errors so that it can be deployed and run properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run build THEN the build SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN running npm run lint THEN only warnings SHALL remain (no errors)
3. WHEN importing modules THEN all imports SHALL resolve correctly
4. WHEN using TypeScript THEN all types SHALL be properly defined and exported
