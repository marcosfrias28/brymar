# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining frontend integration issues with the DDD architecture. The current implementation has TypeScript compilation errors where frontend components are trying to call methods that don't exist on DTOs, and there are still unused files and inconsistent patterns throughout the codebase. The goal is to achieve zero compilation errors and a completely clean, production-ready codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Frontend DTO Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend components to work correctly with the DDD DTOs so that there are no TypeScript compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend components access user data THEN they SHALL use the correct DTO properties and methods
2. WHEN DTOs are used in components THEN they SHALL provide all necessary methods for frontend consumption
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN there SHALL be zero type errors
4. WHEN components need entity IDs THEN they SHALL access them through proper DTO methods
5. IF DTOs need additional methods THEN they SHALL be added following DDD patterns

### Requirement 2: Update All Frontend Pages to Use DDD Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend pages and components to use the new DDD hooks and services so that the architecture is consistent throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages need user data THEN they SHALL use the DDD-based useUser hook
2. WHEN pages need property data THEN they SHALL use DDD-based property hooks
3. WHEN pages need land data THEN they SHALL use DDD-based land hooks
4. WHEN pages need blog data THEN they SHALL use DDD-based blog hooks
5. WHEN server actions are called THEN they SHALL use the DDD presentation layer actions
6. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL receive data from DDD use cases

### Requirement 3: Remove Unused Files and Clean Up Project

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused files, utilities, and legacy code removed so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy utility files exist THEN they SHALL be removed if no longer needed
2. WHEN duplicate implementations exist THEN the old ones SHALL be removed
3. WHEN unused imports exist THEN they SHALL be removed
4. WHEN unused variables exist THEN they SHALL be removed
5. WHEN deprecated files exist THEN they SHALL be deleted
6. WHEN console statements exist for debugging THEN they SHALL be removed or replaced with proper logging

### Requirement 4: Ensure Complete DDD Pattern Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire application to follow DDD patterns consistently so that the architecture is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic exists THEN it SHALL be in the domain layer
2. WHEN data access occurs THEN it SHALL go through repositories
3. WHEN use cases are called THEN they SHALL coordinate domain operations
4. WHEN DTOs are used THEN they SHALL properly encapsulate data transfer
5. WHEN presentation layer components exist THEN they SHALL only handle UI concerns
6. IF any non-DDD patterns remain THEN they SHALL be refactored to follow DDD principles

### Requirement 5: Achieve Zero Compilation Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to compile without any errors so that it can be deployed to production successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run build THEN there SHALL be zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running npm run lint THEN there SHALL be zero blocking lint errors
3. WHEN running type checking THEN all types SHALL be properly defined and used
4. WHEN accessing object properties THEN they SHALL exist on the type definitions
5. WHEN calling methods THEN they SHALL be defined on the objects
6. IF any warnings remain THEN they SHALL be non-blocking and documented
