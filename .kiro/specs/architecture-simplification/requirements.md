# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for simplifying the current Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture to a more maintainable, KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) approach. The goal is to reduce complexity by 80% while maintaining all existing features through centralized types, actions, hooks, and better-organized components.

## Glossary

- **Current_System**: The existing DDD-based Next.js application with complex layered architecture
- **Simplified_System**: The target simplified architecture with centralized organization
- **Feature_Parity**: Maintaining all existing functionality during the architectural transition
- **KISS_Principle**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - prioritizing simplicity and maintainability
- **Centralized_Types**: Single source of truth for TypeScript type definitions
- **Action_Layer**: Simplified server actions replacing complex use cases and DTOs
- **Hook_Layer**: Custom React hooks for state management and data fetching
- **Component_Layer**: Organized React components with clear separation of concerns

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified architecture that reduces file count by 80% while maintaining all features, so that the codebase is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the architecture simplification is complete, THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain 100% feature parity with the Current_System
2. WHEN counting files in the new architecture, THE Simplified_System SHALL contain no more than 20% of the current file count
3. WHEN a developer reviews the codebase, THE Simplified_System SHALL follow KISS_Principle throughout all layers
4. WHEN building the application, THE Simplified_System SHALL compile without errors and pass all existing tests
5. WHERE performance is concerned, THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain or improve current performance metrics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized type definitions, so that I can easily find and maintain TypeScript interfaces without navigating complex folder structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Simplified_System SHALL consolidate all TypeScript types into a single centralized location
2. WHEN a developer needs to reference a type, THE Simplified_System SHALL provide clear import paths from the centralized types
3. THE Simplified_System SHALL eliminate duplicate type definitions across the codebase
4. WHEN types are updated, THE Simplified_System SHALL ensure changes propagate correctly through TypeScript compilation
5. THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain type safety equivalent to the Current_System

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified server actions replacing the complex DDD layers, so that I can implement business logic without navigating through DTOs, use cases, and repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Simplified_System SHALL replace all existing DTOs with direct TypeScript interfaces
2. THE Simplified_System SHALL replace all use cases with simplified server actions
3. THE Simplified_System SHALL replace the repository pattern with direct database operations
4. WHEN implementing new features, THE Simplified_System SHALL require only server action creation instead of multiple layer implementations
5. THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain all existing API functionality through the simplified actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized React hooks for state management, so that I can manage application state without complex service layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Simplified_System SHALL consolidate all data fetching logic into custom React hooks
2. THE Simplified_System SHALL replace complex service layers with hook-based state management
3. WHEN components need data, THE Simplified_System SHALL provide hooks with clear, predictable interfaces
4. THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain all existing state management functionality
5. THE Simplified_System SHALL ensure hooks follow React best practices for performance and reusability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want better organized components with clear separation of concerns, so that I can find and modify UI elements efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Simplified_System SHALL organize components by feature rather than technical layers
2. THE Simplified_System SHALL eliminate unnecessary component abstractions and wrappers
3. WHEN a developer needs to modify a feature, THE Simplified_System SHALL co-locate related components logically
4. THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain all existing UI functionality and styling
5. THE Simplified_System SHALL ensure components remain reusable and testable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove the complex DDD infrastructure while preserving all business logic, so that I can focus on feature development rather than architectural overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Simplified_System SHALL eliminate the application, domain, and infrastructure layers
2. THE Simplified_System SHALL preserve all existing business rules and validation logic
3. WHEN business logic changes are needed, THE Simplified_System SHALL allow direct modification without layer navigation
4. THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain all existing error handling and validation
5. THE Simplified_System SHALL ensure data integrity equivalent to the Current_System

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a migration strategy that ensures zero downtime and data loss, so that the architectural changes can be implemented safely in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Simplified_System SHALL provide a step-by-step migration plan from Current_System to Simplified_System
2. WHEN migrating features, THE Simplified_System SHALL allow incremental replacement of DDD components
3. THE Simplified_System SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition period
4. THE Simplified_System SHALL include rollback procedures for each migration step
5. THE Simplified_System SHALL preserve all existing data and user sessions during migration
