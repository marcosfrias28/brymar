# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining work needed to make the DDD architecture functional with real database connections and working use cases. The focus is on simplicity - connecting the existing code to work properly with Vercel Postgres and Drizzle ORM without overengineering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Working Database Connections

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to connect properly to Vercel Postgres so that data operations work in both development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect successfully to the Vercel Postgres database
2. WHEN repositories are used THEN they SHALL perform actual database operations using Drizzle ORM
3. WHEN CRUD operations are performed THEN they SHALL persist data correctly to the database
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with meaningful error messages
5. IF the database is unavailable THEN the application SHALL show appropriate error states

### Requirement 2: Functional Use Cases

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all use cases to work with real data so that the application functionality is complete and not using stub implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UpdateUserProfileUseCase is called THEN it SHALL update user data in the database
2. WHEN SaveWizardDraftUseCase is called THEN it SHALL save draft data to the database
3. WHEN LoadWizardDraftUseCase is called THEN it SHALL retrieve real draft data from the database
4. WHEN PublishWizardUseCase is called THEN it SHALL move data from draft to published state
5. WHEN GenerateAIContentUseCase is called THEN it SHALL generate content using available AI services
6. IF any use case fails THEN it SHALL return proper error messages to the user

### Requirement 3: Clean Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean code without lint warnings so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run lint THEN there SHALL be no blocking lint errors
2. WHEN console statements exist THEN they SHALL be removed or replaced with proper error handling
3. WHEN unused variables exist THEN they SHALL be removed
4. WHEN unused imports exist THEN they SHALL be removed
5. WHEN TypeScript warnings exist THEN they SHALL be fixed
6. IF critical warnings remain THEN they SHALL be documented with reasons
