# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of Brymar Real Estate Platform from a traditional layered architecture to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Clean Architecture. The platform is currently built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM. The migration aims to achieve clear domain separation, centralized business logic, and improved testability and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Domain Layer Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a pure domain layer with entities, value objects, and domain services, so that business logic is centralized and independent of external concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating domain entities THEN the system SHALL implement them as pure TypeScript classes with no external dependencies
2. WHEN defining value objects THEN the system SHALL ensure they are immutable and validate data at construction time
3. WHEN implementing domain services THEN the system SHALL contain only business logic without infrastructure dependencies
4. WHEN organizing domain code THEN the system SHALL separate each bounded context (User, Property, Land, Content, Wizard, Analytics) into distinct modules
5. IF domain logic needs external data THEN the system SHALL define repository interfaces in the domain layer

### Requirement 2: Application Layer Use Cases

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement use cases that coordinate domain operations, so that application logic is separated from business rules and infrastructure concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating use cases THEN the system SHALL implement one use case per business action
2. WHEN defining use case inputs THEN the system SHALL use DTOs with proper validation
3. WHEN implementing use cases THEN the system SHALL coordinate domain entities and services without containing business logic
4. WHEN use cases need external services THEN the system SHALL depend only on interfaces defined in the application layer
5. WHEN handling transactions THEN the system SHALL manage them at the application layer level

### Requirement 3: Infrastructure Layer Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement infrastructure concerns separately from business logic, so that the system can adapt to different technologies without affecting core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle ORM while implementing domain repository interfaces
2. WHEN accessing external services THEN the system SHALL implement application layer interfaces
3. WHEN handling database operations THEN the system SHALL map between domain entities and database schemas
4. WHEN configuring infrastructure THEN the system SHALL keep all configuration separate from domain and application layers
5. IF database schema changes THEN the system SHALL only require changes in the infrastructure layer

### Requirement 4: Presentation Layer Adaptation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to adapt the presentation layer to use clean architecture principles, so that UI concerns are separated from business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing server actions THEN the system SHALL act as adapters that delegate to use cases
2. WHEN handling form data THEN the system SHALL map inputs to use case DTOs
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL map use case outputs to presentation formats
4. WHEN validating user input THEN the system SHALL perform UI validation in addition to domain validation
5. IF use case interfaces change THEN the system SHALL only require adapter layer updates

### Requirement 5: Bounded Context Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize code by bounded contexts, so that related functionality is grouped together and dependencies are clear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing User Management THEN the system SHALL include authentication, profiles, and roles
2. WHEN organizing Property Management THEN the system SHALL include properties, drafts, and media handling
3. WHEN organizing Land Management THEN the system SHALL include land entities and their specific business rules
4. WHEN organizing Content Management THEN the system SHALL include blog, pages, and sections
5. WHEN organizing Wizard System THEN the system SHALL include unified wizard functionality
6. WHEN organizing Analytics THEN the system SHALL include metrics and reporting capabilities
7. IF contexts need to communicate THEN the system SHALL use well-defined interfaces and avoid direct dependencies

### Requirement 6: Migration Strategy Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the system incrementally, so that functionality remains available during the transition and risks are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting migration THEN the system SHALL begin with the User Management bounded context
2. WHEN migrating each context THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API contracts
3. WHEN implementing new architecture THEN the system SHALL ensure no performance degradation
4. WHEN completing each phase THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive tests covering the migrated functionality
5. IF migration issues occur THEN the system SHALL allow rollback to previous implementation

### Requirement 7: Testing Strategy Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing at each architectural layer, so that the migration maintains system reliability and enables confident refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing domain layer THEN the system SHALL use unit tests for entities and value objects
2. WHEN testing application layer THEN the system SHALL use integration tests for use cases with mocked repositories
3. WHEN testing infrastructure layer THEN the system SHALL use integration tests with real database connections
4. WHEN testing presentation layer THEN the system SHALL test adapter functionality and UI behavior
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve current test coverage levels

### Requirement 8: Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear dependency rules between layers, so that the architecture remains clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing domain layer THEN the system SHALL have no dependencies on other layers
2. WHEN implementing application layer THEN the system SHALL only depend on the domain layer
3. WHEN implementing infrastructure layer THEN the system SHALL implement interfaces from domain and application layers
4. WHEN implementing presentation layer THEN the system SHALL only depend on application layer use cases
5. IF circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent compilation or provide clear error messages

### Requirement 9: Code Organization and Conventions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code organization and naming conventions, so that the codebase is maintainable and new team members can quickly understand the structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN naming classes THEN the system SHALL use PascalCase for Entities, Value Objects, Services, Repositories, and Use Cases
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL have one class per file with descriptive names
3. WHEN creating modules THEN the system SHALL provide barrel exports via index.ts files
4. WHEN implementing dependency injection THEN the system SHALL use constructor injection with interface abstractions
5. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL place them adjacent to the code they test

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to maintain or improve system performance, so that user experience is not negatively impacted by architectural changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating database operations THEN the system SHALL maintain current query performance
2. WHEN implementing use cases THEN the system SHALL not introduce unnecessary abstraction overhead
3. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL maintain current throughput levels
4. WHEN loading application modules THEN the system SHALL support lazy loading where beneficial
5. IF performance regressions are detected THEN the system SHALL provide optimization strategies within the clean architecture constraints
