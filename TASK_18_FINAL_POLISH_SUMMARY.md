- Reduced unnecessary re-renders in layout components
- Optimized class name calculations with memoization
- Implemented efficient animation utility caching
- Added performance monitoring utilities for development

### 2. Animation and Transition Refinement ✅

**Enhanced Animation System:**

- **Reduced Motion Support**: Added `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support
- **Performance Optimized Transitions**: Memoized animation classes and transitions

- **Staggered Animations**: Optimized list and grid animations with proper memoization

**Animation Features:**

- Motion-safe animations with fallbacks
- Cached animation utilities for better performance
- Smooth micro-interactions with secondary color integration
- Optimized staggered list and grid animations

### 3. Comprehensive Accessibility Audit ✅

**Accessibility Enhancements:**

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Created comprehensive audit utilities
- **Automated Testing**: Implemented accessibility checker with caching
- **Screen Reader Support**: Enhanced ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Improved focus management and keyboard accessibility

**Accessibility Features:**

- Comprehensive accessibility audit system (`lib/utils/accessibility-audit.ts`)
- Performance-optimized accessibility checker with caching
- WCAG compliance validation for images, headings, contrast, and keyboard access
- Enhanced focus management and screen reader support

### 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility ✅

**Browser Support Features:**

- **Feature Detection**: Comprehensive browser capability detection
- **Polyfill Management**: Smart polyfill loading based on feature support
- **CSS Compatibility**: Vendor prefix utilities and fallback support
- **Performance Optimization**: Browser-specific optimizations

**Compatibility Features:**

- Modern feature detection (CSS Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties, etc.)
- JavaScript compatibility utilities with fallbacks
- CSS compatibility helpers with vendor prefixes
